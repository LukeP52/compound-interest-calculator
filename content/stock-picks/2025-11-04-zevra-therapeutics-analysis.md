Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. ($ZVRA) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in rare disease treatments, particularly for central nervous system (CNS) disorders with limited or no available therapies. Originally founded as KemPharm, Inc. in 2006, it rebranded to Zevra Therapeutics in March 2023 to reflect its focus on rare diseases—**"Zevra" meaning "zebra" in Greek**, symbolizing the rarity of these conditions.

Headquartered in Celebration, Florida, Zevra employs a **data-driven, patient-first approach** to develop transformational therapies, leveraging proprietary prodrug technology to improve drug profiles for better efficacy, safety, and convenience.

## Business Focus & Portfolio

The company has **two commercial products**, including **Arimoclomol** (approved for Niemann-Pick disease type C) and another for CNS indications, with a late-stage pipeline featuring candidates like:

- **KP1077 (olcegepant)**: For idiopathic hypersomnia
- **Serdexmethylphenidate (SDX)**: For narcolepsy and other rare disorders

Zevra went public in 2015 (as KemPharm) and trades on Nasdaq, targeting unmet needs in areas like narcolepsy, Niemann-Pick, and other neurodegenerative rare diseases through acquisitions, partnerships, and internal development.

## Mission & Strategy

Zevra's mission is to bring life-changing therapeutics to patients with rare diseases, combining science, data, and patient insights to address significant gaps in treatment options. It operates a diverse portfolio, including commercial assets and clinical-stage programs, with a focus on U.S. markets but potential for global expansion through regulatory approvals.

**Key milestone**: The **FDA approval of Arimoclomol in 2024** marked its transition to a revenue-generating entity, with ongoing trials for KP1077 potentially expanding its CNS footprint.
