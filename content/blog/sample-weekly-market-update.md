## Market Overview

The major indices posted solid gains this week, with the S&P 500 climbing 2.1% and the Nasdaq advancing 2.8%. The tech-heavy rally was driven by strong earnings reports from major technology companies and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve.

### Key Market Movements

- **S&P 500**: Up 2.1% to 4,450
